              <h3>  Article 1: Create a study schedule</h3>
                <p>Consistency is key. Set aside specific times each day for studying, and stick to them. Breaking study sessions into manageable chunks (like 25-50 minutes with short breaks) can improve focus and retention—a technique known as the Pomodoro Technique.</p>

                        <p>Your surroundings affect your ability to concentrate. Choose a quiet, well-lit space, free from distractions. Some people study best with soft background music, while others prefer silence—experiment to find what works for you.</p>

                <h3> Article 3:Take effective notes</h3>
                <p>Writing down key points helps you process and remember information. Use techniques like mind maps, bullet points, or highlighting to make notes organized and visually clear. Rewriting notes in your own words strengthens understanding.</p>
