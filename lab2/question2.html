            <p>Mountains are large natural landforms that rise high above the surrounding land. They are formed by movements of the Earthâ€™s crust, volcanic activity, or erosion over time. Covered with forests, rivers, snow, and diverse wildlife, mountains are home to many plants and animals. They also provide fresh water through glaciers and rainfall. For people, mountains are a source of beauty, adventure, and resources, while also playing an important role in balancing the environment and climate. </p>

            <p>Rivers are natural flowing streams of water that usually begin in mountains or hills and travel across land before joining seas or oceans. They provide fresh water for drinking, farming, and daily use. Rivers also support many plants, animals, and fish, making them an important part of nature. Along their banks, fertile soil helps crops grow, and many cities are built near rivers. Besides being useful, rivers are also beautiful and bring life wherever they flow.</p>

            <p>Deserts are dry, sandy regions of the Earth that receive very little rainfall. They often have extreme temperatures, being very hot during the day and cold at night. Despite the harsh conditions, deserts are home to special plants like cacti and animals such as camels, snakes, and lizards that can survive with little water. Deserts also have unique landscapes of sand dunes and rocky plains. They are important parts of nature, showing how life can adapt even in tough environments.</p>
